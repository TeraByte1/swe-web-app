# CS4800.03 Web Application
The purpose of this class project is to create an application to predict the likelihood, or percentage, of getting severe COVID-19 symptoms based on patient characteristics, such as age, gender, ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. As part of the Class Project Architecture, our group has the role of creating a Web Application that will create the User-Interface (UI) that will interact with the patient and receive feedback. Additionally, with our Web Application, we will be in communications with the Web Services team in order to efficiently execute and integrate the UI with the backend.
