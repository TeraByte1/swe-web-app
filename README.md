# CS4800.03 Web Application
For this compiler project, we are implementing a syntax analyzer for the programming language Toy, as defined in Project 1 - Lexical Analyzer. A CFG G was defined based on a Backus Normal Form (BNF) description. From this, we wrote a program to create a parsing table for G, and performed a one-symbol lookahead parsing on various input Toy programs, as well as printed appropriate parsing actions.
